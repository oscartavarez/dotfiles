## Sourcefonts for Releases

Here reside all source fonts that are used for releases. These fonts
are fully supported, following renaming schemes and having possible specific
patch-flags that must be used for best results (in their `config.*` files).

To try things out on all fonts here is also a list of one specimen each for
all the fonts in `fontfilenames`. This can be used via

        $ cat fontfilenames | xargs fontforge .....
